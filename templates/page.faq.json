The main difference between a replica (or fan \/ stadium) jersey and an authentic (official) jersey is pretty straightforward - one is made for the fan and the other is designed specifically for the player. Replica jerseys are very similar to the authentic jerseys in terms of appearance, but there are usually a few small differences between the two with regards to design and fit. The authentic jersey is what the players wear in the game. It usually has a more tailored fit to it, small holes (or vents) in the rib \/ neck area and costs a bit more as well.<\/p>"
